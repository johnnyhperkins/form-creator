# BorderBox

### [View BorderBox Live](https://borderbox.johnnyhperkins.now.sh)

BorderBox is a drag and drop form creator built with React Hooks, GraphQL/Apollo, and Mongoose.

## Functionality

Create forms with any number of text or textarea fields, drag and drop to re-order them, and finally publish the form with a unique public url to share. The owner of the form has access to a reporting screen of all registered answers.

## Local set up

Run `yarn dev` in root to start the Apollo server and `yarn start` in the client directory to start react scripts. You'll also need to create a .env file in the root with the API keys (provided on request)
